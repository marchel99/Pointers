# Pointers

This repository contains a collection of C programming exercises focusing on pointers. The exercises cover a range of concepts related to pointers, such as pointer arithmetic, pointer to pointer, passing pointers to functions, dynamic memory allocation, and more.

To help me in my learning journey, I have also used the video tutorial "Pointers in C / C++ [Full Course]" by  freeCodeCamp.org on YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuegQmMdy8M&t). This tutorial provided me with a solid foundation in understanding pointers in C and helped me to better tackle the exercises in this repository.

I have created this repository to document my progress and struggles with C pointers and to share my solutions with others who may be facing similar challenges. Each exercise is accompanied by a description of the problem, my thought process and approach to solving it, and the code implementation.

As someone who has struggled with C pointers, I hope this repository will serve as a resource for others who are also struggling to understand this important concept in C programming. I welcome feedback, suggestions, and collaboration from the community to improve the exercises and solutions in this repository.
